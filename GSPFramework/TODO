* replace the mod@outport - mod2@inport    by    mod#outport - inport#mod2
  (or maybe use only @s)
* ^ patch the viewer accordingly
* decide if we keep the old « from="" to="" » version 


* handle const in mangling (calling with a -const should work if the
   interface has const)
* => update the examples (Cpp::Log) accordingly


* handle possibility for a module to know if it has some "clients" on an output
* metamodules in .xml (a module as an assembly of modules) (could be a special type of modules like C modules with a namespace c: ==> e.g. xml:path/to/metatrucs.xml/Div)

* OPT: add a define that generate a human oriented version of the struct (use e.g. ___NL___ for new lines, then replace them all by a real new line in the helper script)
