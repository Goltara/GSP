* CPP: namespaces

* unallocated module when stopping pipeline

* idea: replace a#b#c by something asymetric (e.g. a(b)c or a[b]c or a]b[c or a)b(c (no <> as in xml)) ...



* could pass a more opaque structure as Pointer (when invoking a java
   method with a C/C++ pointer)
=> it would also minize the requirements to build some java module (do
   not require jna if the op on pointers are usual)
=> could also put some custom metatype info in it (to pass it back to C)


* handle possibility for a module to know if it has some "clients" on an output
* metamodules in .xml (a module as an assembly of modules) (could be a special type of modules like C modules with a namespace c: ==> e.g. xml:path/to/metatrucs.xml/Div)

* OPT: add a define that generate a human oriented version of the struct (use e.g. ___NL___ for new lines, then replace them all by a real new line in the helper script)
