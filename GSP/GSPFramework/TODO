* helpers in .xml file (see c-pipeline.xml)
* handle possibility for a module to know if it has some "clients" on an output
* metamodules in .xml (a module as an assembly of modules)

* typecheck on calls from Java to C (events)
* use C++ typeid (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typeid) to implement a less macrofied version for c++ (keep both approaches)

* OPT: add a define that generate a human oriented version of the struct (use e.g. ___NL___ for new lines, then replace them all by a real new line in the helper script)
