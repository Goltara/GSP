* helpers in .xml file (see c-pipeline.xml)
* handle possibility for a module to know if it has some "clients" on an output
* metamodules in .xml (a module as an assembly of modules) (could be a special type of modules like C modules with a namespace c: ==> e.g. xml:path/to/metatrucs.xml/Div)

* typecheck on calls from Java to C (events), and from C to C

* OPT: add a define that generate a human oriented version of the struct (use e.g. ___NL___ for new lines, then replace them all by a real new line in the helper script)
